I'm an Econ PhD Student at University of Michigan with interest in Public Finance, Industrial Organization and Labor. Previously Econ Research Specialist at Princeton University. I got my bachelor degree in economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP). My main fields of interest are Development, Poverty and Data Science. I have conducted laboratory experiments at the Behavioral and Experimental Economics Laboratory (GECE-PUCP), managed field experiments in Peru with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), and I was a RA at the Research Center of Universidad del Pacífico in Peru.

We conduct a field experiment in the metropolitan area of the Dominican Republic to study the impact of sending voice messages on early immunization behavior.Target message recipients were households that included either women who were at least six months pregnant or with children five years old or less. We found significant spillover effects by the Vice-President voice messages.

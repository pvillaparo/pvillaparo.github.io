We study how individuals working in small firms in Peru decide to plan and save for retirement in different options. We use a novel and unique data from a survey applied in Lima Metropolitan area in 2018, which contains information about expectations, planning and saving actions the individuals have taken for retirement. Our results indicate that, contrary to the common assumption, they do think about retirement, plan and take some actions to finance it. The saving option most frequently chosen is having their own business, and the less chosen is saving through pension systems.

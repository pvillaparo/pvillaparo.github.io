excerpt: 'I study the implementation and repeal of Peruâ€™s Agrarian Promotion Law to quantify how policy wedges reshape worker sorting, wages, and employment. This reform modified profit taxes for eligible agro-industrial firms and introduced a flexible agrarian labor regime within the span of 2001-2025.'
